Please perform the following coding exercise and return your code within 2 hours.  Style & panache count.  You can use these technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery.

The web page should show a list of 10 edit fields, each with an accompanying label.
The user can enter text into any field.
When the user has paused typing, the fields visually sort themselves on the screen.  Empty fields sort to the end of the list, otherwise use increasing alphabetic order.
Please animate field reorder so that the fields 'move' to their new positions rather than immediately repositioning.
Reorder animation takes no more than 1 second.

You should deliver your code as a folder containing an 'index.html' file that can be opened in a browser.
